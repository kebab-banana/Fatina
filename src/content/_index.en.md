## Tween

A tween (from [_in-between_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inbetweening)) is a concept that allows you to change the values of the properties of an object in a smooth way. You just tell it which properties you want to change, which final values should they have when the tween finishes running, and how long should this take, and the tweening engine will take care of finding the intermediate values from the starting to the ending point.

## What is Fatina ?

Fatina is a new tweening library designed to be easy to use and easy to understand.
The main inspiration is the <b>C#</b> library [DOTween](http://dotween.demigiant.com/) made for <b>Unity</b>

## Special thanks to
* [Unity-chan](http://unity-chan.com/) for all those sprites, thanks to her I was able to make cute samples ...
* [Tina.js](https://github.com/Wizcorp/tina.js) who made me rage so much with all those nasty bugs everywhere

## Why this name ?
* **Fat** Tina: Because everyone knows typescript is fat, heavy and slow
* Reference to **Fatina** from [Tower of Druaga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tower_of_Druaga_(anime))
